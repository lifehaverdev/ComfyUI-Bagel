</p>

BAGEL is an open-source multimodal foundation model with 7B active parameters (14B total) that adopts a Mixture-of-Transformer-Experts (MoT) architecture. It is designed for multimodal understanding and generation tasks, outperforming top-tier open-source VLMs like Qwen2.5-VL and InternVL-2.5 on standard multimodal understanding leaderboards, and delivering text-to-image quality competitive with specialist generators such as SD3.

## Features

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Generate high-quality images using natural language prompts
- **Image Editing**: Edit existing images based on textual descriptions  
- **Image Understanding**: Perform Q&A and analysis on images
- **Reasoning Process Display**: Optionally display the model's reasoning process
